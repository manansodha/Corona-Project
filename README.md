# Corona Project

Hi there! This here is my high school project which I made in 2020. This is a simple program which uses Python Pandas and Matplot library.

The main the application of this project is that user is able to enter details regarding number covid patients, healed and deaths in date-wise manner and also, provide the user graphical representation of the trends created using the data that is given.

Some information regarding the project: 
* This is a terminal based application with simple UI of menus.
* There are three menus with easy manuverability among each of them.
  * The first/main menu is the one where use can select what they want to do with the data or if the want to exit.

  * The second menu is the reading menu, i.e., this will show options to disply data or go back to the main menu.
